- Python: use `uv run`
- Install python packages: `/install`
- Compile VST: `./vst/compile.sh -d` (drop `-d` for release)
- For long commands or commands that output a lot of tokens (e.g. compiling):
  - Use: `.claude/hooks/run-with-log.sh <command>`
  - Example: `.claude/hooks/run-with-log.sh ./vst/compile.sh -d`
  - This `tee`s the output to a file and to stdout. You can head/tail the stdout.
  - If you need more than what you got from head/tail, you can inspect the log file instead or re-running.
  - Always run `run-with-log.sh` commands in the background so we can continue working while they execute.
- Don't make Edits immediately after propsing an alternate solution -- ask for confirmation first.
- If you explain multiple ways something could be done, ask me which one I want before proceding with Edits
