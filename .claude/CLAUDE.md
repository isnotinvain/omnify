- Python: use `uv run`
- Install python packages: `/install`
- Compile VST: `./vst/compile.sh -d` (drop `-d` for release)
- For long commands or commands that output a lot of tokens (e.g. compiling):
  - Use: `.claude/hooks/run-with-log.sh <command>`
  - Example: `.claude/hooks/run-with-log.sh ./vst/compile.sh -d`
  - This logs to a temp file, opens it in VSCode, and waits for completion
  - After it exits, inspect the tmp file as needed (be efficient with tokens)
- Don't make Edits immediately after propsing an alternate solution -- ask for confirmation first.
- If you explain multiple ways something could be done, ask me which one I want before proceding with Edits
